In social studies, a political ideology is a certain set of ethical ideals, principles,doctrines, myths or symbols<br>
 of a social movement, institution, class or large group that explains how society should work and offers<br>
  some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order. A political ideology largely concerns itself <br>
  with how to allocate power and to what ends it should be used. Some political parties follow a certain<br>
   ideology very closely while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without <br>
   specifically embracing any one of them. The popularity of an ideology is in part due to the influence of<br>
   moral entrepreneurs, who sometimes act in their own interests. Political ideologies have two dimensions:<br>
    (1) goals: how society should be organized; and (2) methods: the most appropriate way to achieve this goal.<br>

A  company is a legal person. It is incorporated in accordance with the law governing such entities in the <br>
country where such a company is formed. The affairs of the company are managed in accordance with its	<br>
 constitution adopted by its members at the time of its formation. Under no circumstances, a company can <br>
 do anything that is in violation of its constitution. Any act done by a company in violation of its constitution<br>
  is ultra vires and hence null and void.

<p style="font-family: 'Acme';">
One of the questions I wanted to answer when I wrote my latest book Mean People Suck is: Why does empathy seem<br> 
 to disappear somewhere between childhood and adulthood so we end up living in a world where a lot of people, from<br> 
  managers to decision-makers, and especially to politicians, appear to be clueless when it comes to empathy? The thing<br> 
 is, kids are naturally empathetic. Just watch a toddler relate to a friend who's hurt or even a Pixar movie character and<br> 
  you'll see empathy in action from a young age.<br> <br> 
But, when you get to the adult world, poof, it's gone. It's more a rarity rather than an everyday thing. It's as if people take their<br> 
 empathy, lock it in a box, and bury it in the sand along with their heads. Then, they only bring it out when it's convenient, a<br> 
  sort of selective empathy.

The red flag was one of first anarchist symbols and it was widely used in late 19th century by anarchists<br>
worldwide. Peter Kropotkin preferred the use of the red flag.The red banner, which has always stood for<br>
liberty, frightens the executioners because it is so red with our blood. Those red and black banners wave<br>
over us mourning our dead and wave over our hopes for the dawn that is breaking.<br>

The black flag and the color black in general have been associated with anarchism since the 1880s. Many <br>
anarchist collectives contain the word "black" in their names. There have been a number of anarchist periodicals<br>
 entitled Black Flag.<br><br>
The uniform blackness of the flag is in stark contrast to the colorful flags typical of most nation states. Additionally,<br>
 as a white flag has been used to request parley or to surrender, the black flag symbolizes defiance and opposition<br>
  to surrender.

  Christian democracy is a political ideology that emerged in 19th-century Europe under the influence of Catholic social <br>

  Communitarianism is a philosophy that emphasizes the connection between the individual and the community. Its overriding <br>
  philosophy is based upon the belief that a person's social identity and personality are largely molded by community relationships<br>
  , with a smaller degree of development being placed on individualism. Although the community might be a family, communitarianism<br>
   usually is understood, in the wider, philosophical sense, as a collection of interactions, among a community of people in a given<br>
    place (geographical location), or among a community who share an interest or who share a history. Communitarianism usually<br>
	 opposes extreme individualism and disagrees with extreme laissez-faire policies that neglect the stability of the overall community.

  Communism (from Latin communis, "common, universal") is a philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement<br>
   whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of<br>
    common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money, and the state.<br><br>
	Communism includes a variety of schools of thought, which broadly include Marxism and social anarchism	(anarcho-communism), <br>
	as well as the political ideologies grouped around both. All of these share the analysis that the current order of society stems from<br>
	 its economic system, capitalism; that in this system there are two major social classes; that conflict between these two classes is the <br>
	root of all problems in society;and that this situation will ultimately be resolved through a social revolution.

 Communist symbolism represents a variety of themes, including revolution, the proletariat, peasantry, agriculture, or international<br>
  solidarity. Communist states, parties and movements use these symbols to advance and create solidarity within their cause. These<br>
   symbols often appear in yellow and red. The flag of the Soviet Union incorporated a yellow-outlined red star and a yellow hammer<br>
    and sickle on red. The flags of Vietnam, China, North Korea, Angola and Mozambique would all incorporate similar symbolism<br>
	 under communist rule.<br><br>
The hammer and sickle have become the pan-communist symbol[citation needed], appearing on the flags of most communist parties<br>
 around the world. Some parties have a modified version of hammer and sickle as their symbol, most notably the Workers' Party of<br>
  Korea which includes a hammer representing industrial workers, a hoe representing agricultural workers and a brush (traditional <br>
  writing-implement) representing the intelligentsia.

  Authoritarianism is a form of government characterized by strong central power and limited political freedoms. Political scientists<br>
   have created many typologies describing variations of authoritarian forms of government. Authoritarian regimes may be either <br>
   autocratic or oligarchic in nature, and may be based upon the rule of a party or the military.<br><br>
   Minimally defined, an authoritarian government lacks free and competitive direct elections to legislatures, free and competitive <br>
   direct or indirect elections for executives, or both. Broadly defined, authoritarian states include countries that lack the civil <br>
   liberties such as freedom of religion, or countries in which the government and the opposition do not alternate in power at <br>
   least once following free elections. Authoritarian states might contain nominally democratic institutions, such as political<br>
    parties, legislatures and elections, which are managed to entrench authoritarian rule; thus, a dictatorship can feature fraudulent, <br>
	non-competitive elections. Since 1946, the share of authoritarian states in the international political system increased until <br>
	the mid-1970s, but declined from then until the year 2000.

Corporatism is a political ideology which advocates the organization of society by corporate groups, such as agricultural, labour, <br>
military, scientific, or guild associations on the basis of their common interests. The term is derived from the Latin corpus, or <br>
"human body". The hypothesis that society will reach a peak of harmonious functioning when each of its divisions efficiently<br>

In political science, a reactionary can be defined as a person or entity holding political views that favour a return to a previous<br>
 political state of society that they believe possessed characteristics that are negatively absent from the contemporary status <br>
 quo of a society. As an adjective, the word reactionary describes points of view and policies meant to restore a past status quo.<br>
 <br>
The word reactionary is often used in the context of the left-right political spectrum, and is one tradition in right-wing politics.<br>
 In popular usage, it is commonly used to refer to a highly conservative position, one opposed to social or political progress.<br>
  However, according to political theorist Mark Lilla, a reactionary yearns to overturn a present condition of decadence and<br>
   recover an idealized past. Such reactionary individuals and policies favour social transformation, in contrast to conservative<br>
    individuals or policies that seek to preserve what exists in the present</p>

Democracy (Greek: "demokrat", literally "rule by people") is a form of government in which the people have the<br>
 authority to choose their governing legislation. Who people are and how authority is shared among them are core issues for<br>
  democratic development and constitution. Some cornerstones of these issues are freedom of assembly and speech, inclusiveness <br>
  and equality, membership, consent, voting, right to life and minority rights.<br>
  Democracy is a system of processing conflicts in which outcomes depend on what participants do, but no single force controls<br>
   what occurs and its outcomes. The uncertainty of outcomes is inherent in democracy. Democracy makes all forces struggle<br>
    repeatedly to realize their interests and devolves power from groups of people to sets of rules.

candidates seem more attractive. With a distinct association to media bias, it commonly refers to how a reporter, news organization, <br>
or TV show covers political candidates and policy issues. <br>
Bias emerges in a political context when individuals engage an inability or unwillingness to understand a politically opposing point <br>
of view. Such bias in individuals may have roots in each individual's traits and thinking styles, and it is not clear whether individuals<br>
 at particular positions along the political spectrum are more biased than any other individuals.

<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Acme';">
Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that affirms one's prior beliefs or <br>
hypotheses. It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning. People display this bias when they gather<br>
 or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect is stronger for desired outcomes,<br>
 for emotionally charged issues, and for deeply-entrenched beliefs.<br>
People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory<br>
 have been invoked to explain attitude polarization (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties <br>
 are exposed to the same evidence), belief perseverance (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the <br>
 irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and illusory correlation (when people <br>
 falsely perceive an association betweentwo events or situations).

<br>
<h2  style="font-family: 'Pacifico';">False Consensus Bias</h2>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Acme';">
In psychology, the false-consensus effect or false-consensus bias is an attributional type of cognitive bias whereby people tend to <br>
overestimate the extent to which their own opinions, beliefs, preferences, values, and habits are normal and typical of those of others<br>
 (i.e., that others also think the same way that they do). This cognitive bias tends to lead to the perception of a consensus that does<br>
 not exist, a "false consensus".
<br>
This false consensus is significant because it increases or decreases self-esteem, the overconfidence effect or a belief that everyone <br>
knows one's own knowledge. It can be derived from a desire to conform and be liked by others in a social environment. This bias<br>
 is especially prevalent in group settings where one thinks the collective opinion of their own group matches that of the larger <br>
 population. Since the members of a group reach a consensus and rarely encounter those who dispute it, they tend to believe <br>
 that everybody thinks the same way. The false-consensus effect is not restricted to cases where people believe that their<br>
  values are shared by the majority, but it still manifests as an overestimate of the extent of their belief.

<p style="font-family: 'Acme';">
When stories focus on what has the potential to occur with speculative phrasing such as may, what if and could rather than<br>
 focusing on the factual evidence of what has and/or definitely will occur. This further speculative bias when the piece is not <br>
 specifically labelled as an opinion and analysis article. This occurs in a political context particularly in the introduction of<br>
 policies or the addressing of opposing policies. This bias allows parties to make their policies more appealing and appear<br>
 to address issues more directly, by speculating the positive and negative outcomes.

<h2 style="font-family: 'Pacifico';">Gatekeeping Bias
</h2>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Acme';">
This type of bias exists through the use of ideological selection, deselection and/or omission of stories based on individualised<br>
 opinions. Similarly related to agenda bias, existing primarily when the focus is on politicians and how they choose to cover<br>
  and present preferred policy discussions and issues.
